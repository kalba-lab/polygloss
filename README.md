# Polygloss

**E-commerce that speaks every language**

Self-hosted multilingual store engine. Native multi-language support built into the core, not bolted on as a plugin.

## Problem

Machine translation (Google Translate, browser plugins) doesn't work well for e-commerce. Product names get mangled, descriptions lose meaning, customers lose trust. Sales follow.

## Solution

Every piece of content is human-approved before going live. AI can generate drafts to speed up your workflow, but you review and edit before anything reaches customers.

    A[Create product] --> B[Auto-translate via AI]
    B --> C[Review & edit]
    C --> D[Publish]
    D --> E[Customers see quality content]
```

## How it works

1. **Create product** in your primary language
2. **Auto-translate** to all other languages with one click (via DeepL API)
3. **Review and edit** - fix nuances, adjust tone, correct terminology
4. **Save** - only human-approved content goes live

This is not machine translation for customers. This is a productivity tool for content managers.

## AI Translation Setup

AI-assisted translation requires a DeepL API key. Each deployment uses its own API key - no shared tokens, full control over usage and costs.
Without API key, manual translation entry works as usual.

## Payment Integration

Polygloss is intentionally shipped without a payment module. Every business has different requirements - payment providers, merchant accounts, regional regulations.

The checkout flow collects customer data and creates orders. Payment integration is left for the implementer to add based on their specific needs.
